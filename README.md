Optimal control for agentic search and rescue through dynamic wildfire-like obstacles. Namely, our approach using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle (PMP) to get necessary conditions on optimal controls and uses `solve_bvp' to solve a boundary value problem. 

An attractive part of this project is the animations that demonstrate our results. We highlight a few here.

## Optimal control with two fires and varying wind under the initial (unscaled) Gaussian fire model

## Optimal control with two fires, constant wind, and multiple targets to pick up.
